## Inheritance in C++

+ When a class inherits another class, the base class's data
  members are placed first within the memory layout of the derived class object.
  Member functions however are plaecd in seperate code section and shared among
  all the class instances.
+ For member functions compiler generates the code to pass 'this' pointer for any specific object call.
